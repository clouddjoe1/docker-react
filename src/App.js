        TITLE: THE JOY OF WORSHIP
KEY SCRIPTURE: PSALM 84

Many Christians find no joy in worship. Many feels that they must "have
their toes stepped on" in order to get anything out of worship. Others feel
that they have sinned if they feel happy about worship. They say, "I didn't
come to get entertained." This has led to perversions in worship. Some
have sought a wild emotional experience. Others have gone the opposite
route, either going into legalism and cold formality or not worshiping at
all.

In Psalm 84 the psalmist shows us the proper attitude of God's children
toward worship. Worship is a great joy for the true child of God. It is an
opportunity to come before God and express our gratitude for the
greatness of God and the salvation that He has given as a gift to us. In
Psalm 84, the Psalmist shared his trust in the Lord. Our heartfelt trust in
God is the foundation of the joy in worship. When we trust in the Lord,
our worship is more meaningful.
